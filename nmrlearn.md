### Protein NMR resource

[Hoffman Lab Home Page](http://hoffman.cm.utexas.edu/research/) Usefull things for Protein NMR including peptide NMR assignment problem, typical proton NMR chemical shifts for amino acids.

[Reproducible computing for Bio-NMR](https://www.nmrbox.org/) NMRbox VM includes 46 new and 38 updated NMR related software packages 

[CABM Structural Bioinformatics Laboratory](http://www-nmr.cabm.rutgers.edu/index.htm) The lab uses both NMR and X-ray crystallography, along with computational methods, to address questions emerging from genomic and functional genomic analyses. The lab also develops software to automate structure determination by NMR methods. Including the software: AutoAssign, 

[Protein Structure Prediction Center](http://predictioncenter.org/) the goal is to help advance the methods of identifying protein structure from sequence
